1. Main Directory (.):
main.go: This is the main entry point for your application. When you run or build your CLI tool, it starts here. Typically, you won't need to modify this file frequently; it essentially just calls the code from the cmd package to execute your CLI.

go.mod and go.sum: These files are related to Go's module system. go.mod declares the module path and its dependencies. go.sum ensures the integrity of the modules you're using by storing their checksums. When you add new dependencies with go get, these files will be updated.

LICENSE: A license file for your project. It's good practice to include one to specify how others can use, modify, or distribute your project.

premcli: This is the binary (executable) produced when you ran go build -o premcli. It's the compiled version of your CLI application. When you move this file to a directory in your PATH, you can run your CLI commands globally.

TODO.org: This seems to be a TODO list or some kind of organizational file. It's not a standard part of a Go or Cobra project, so I assume it might be for your personal tracking or a feature of Doom Emacs.

2. cmd Directory:
The cmd directory contains the definitions for your CLI's commands, arguments, and flags.

root.go: This file defines the base command for your CLI. For example, when you run premcli without any subcommands, the logic from root.go gets executed. This is also where global flags and persistent settings for your CLI are typically set up.

test.go: This file was generated when you ran cobra add test. It defines the logic for the test subcommand. Each time you want to add a new command, you can use cobra add [command_name] to generate a new file in the cmd directory. Edit the generated file to customize the behavior of that command.

How to Create Commands:
Add a New Command: Use Cobra's add functionality.

bash
Copy code
cobra add [command_name]
This creates a new file in the cmd directory named [command_name].go.

Edit the New Command: Navigate to the new file (e.g., cmd/[command_name].go). You will find boilerplate code for your new command. You can edit the Run function to implement the logic for your command. You can also add flags, arguments, and additional subcommands as needed.

Build and Test: After adding or modifying a command, run go build -o premcli to compile the application and then test your command using the generated binary.

With this structure, you can keep adding and organizing multiple commands, making your CLI as complex as you want while keeping it organized.
